    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>
      The need for online streaming platforms and digital movie databases has made it increasingly important to automatically categorize movies into their respective genres. 
      Movie posters serve as the first point of contact for viewers and often convey essential information about the filmâ€™s style, tone, and content. 
      Predicting genres directly from poster images can help recommendation systems, streaming services, and viewers quickly identify movies of interest, providing a foundation for content organization and discovery.
      This project focuses on multi-label movie genre prediction from poster images, where a single movie may belong to multiple genres simultaneously, such as action and comedy. 
      The task is challenging because posters vary widely in design, color, composition, and artistic style, and the relationship between visual elements and genres is often subtle. 
      To tackle this problem, we leverage publicly available datasets such as IMDb, which provide movie metadata, including genre labels and poster URLs. 
      Poster images are preprocessed by resizing, normalization, and transformation into a format suitable for deep learning models. 
      The core of the approach is building multi-label convolutional neural networks using transfer learning with architectures like ResNet and VGG, which have been pretrained on large-scale image datasets. 
      These models are fine-tuned to extract features relevant for genre classification.
      Since a movie can belong to multiple genres, the output layer uses sigmoid activations, and the model is trained using binary cross-entropy loss to handle multi-label outputs. 
      Evaluation is performed using metrics such as precision, recall, and average AUC per genre, which provide insights into the performance across different categories. 
      Additionally, data augmentation techniques like random flips, rotation, and color jittering are employed to improve the robustness of the model against variations in poster images.
